      <p>Software developer / ex-SEO expert looking to create life-changing software.
      I believe that the modern website needs to engage its users to reap
      the benefits of both conversions as well as search engine exposure. That type of
      user experience comes to fruition when a team works towards one cohesive vision.
      If you'd like me to help your team realize your vision contact me here.</p>
